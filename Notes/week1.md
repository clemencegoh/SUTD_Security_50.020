# Recap of network security

---
- Basics:
    - **C**onfidentiality
        - obtaining secret data
    - **I**ntegrity
        - change data 
    - **A**vailability
        - avaiability of data (no DDOS)
    - **N**on-repudiation
        - once taken action, user cannot deny having taken it

- Others:
    - Non-repudiation
        - as above
    - Privacy
        - user's data (?) not sure exact diff between 
        this and confidentiality
    - Authenticity
        - verify that user making request is valid

Feasibility of attack:
- Mathematically feasible
    - Possibility of attack
    - number of bugs
- Practically feasible
    - Time taken
        - complexity
